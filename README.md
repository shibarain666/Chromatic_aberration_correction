# Chromatic aberration correction algorithm
## Introduction
 - This branch(pub) is still under development.
 - From the original repo(master branch), i found that it's not that powerful for some cases, so i read some paper and try to improve it, the original repo still give a good inspiration.
 - Current result comparison is in imgs folder.

 - It looks like this branch code remove more purple fringing phenomenon, but it still have some artifacts in my modified algorithm, still under development.
